Regarding the scib metrcis: 
 - Cell cycle genes not in the testing adata, therefore it is false
 - trajectory_conservation requires dpt_pseudotime column to adata
 - hvg_score cannot be computed to trvae, might be due to low amount of genes (testing data)
 - To run kbet metric, install kbet see scib details

Before the actual integration:
- Adjust the trvae and trvae_tl epochs


Testing that all the integration methods works (locally and with the dataset from tutorial, as don't yet have the server access), tested methods:
 - scvi
 - scanvi
 - scgen
 - trvae
 - trvae_tl
 - combat
 - conos
 - fastmnn
 - liger -> problem with the quantification
 - seurat_cca
 - seurat_rpca
 - scanorama
 - mnn -> kernel died
 - desc
 - saucie 
 - bbknn 
 - harmony 

 After the testing, yml files were created from the each environment expect mnn



Note the integration metrics are collected before each method is ready, uses the previously computed metrics (I guess), this happened when running desc and bbknn
